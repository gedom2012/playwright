## Project Overview

This project contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for the Sauce Labs checkout process using Playwright, a modern browser automation library. The tests are written in TypeScript and follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better maintainability.

Key Features:

- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- GitHub Actions integration
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Husky Git hooks
- Comprehensive test reporting

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher) or yarn
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gedom2012/playwright.git
   cd playwright
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Verify Playwright browsers are installed**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Environment Setup

The project requires environment variables for authentication. Follow these steps:

1. **Create your .env file**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the .env file with your credentials**:

   ```bash
   USERNAME=your_actual_username
   PASSWORD=your_actual_password
   ```

3. **Important: Never commit your .env file to version control!**

## Docker Support

The project includes Docker configuration for containerized test execution:

### Docker Files

- Dockerfile: Based on official Playwright image with all dependencies

- docker-compose.yaml: Defines the test service with volume mounts

### Running Tests with Docker

- Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker-compose build
```

- Run Tests in Container

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Run Specific Test Command

- Override the default command:

```bash
docker-compose run playwright-test npm run test-firefox
```

### Persistent Reports

Reports are saved to your host machine through mounted volumes:

- ./playwright-report/ - HTML test reports

- ./test-results/ - Test artifacts and screenshots

### Clean Up

- Stop containers and remove volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Running Tests

The project includes some test scripts configured in package.json:

### Basic Commands

- Run tests in Chromium:

```bash
npm run test-chrome
```

- Run tests in Firefox:

```bash
npm run test-firefox
```

- Run tests in WebKit:

```bash
npm run test-webkit
```

- Run tests in all browsers in parallel:

```bash
npm run test-all
```

### Advanced Options

- Run specific test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/checkout.spec.ts
```

- Run in headed mode (visible browser):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

- Generate trace for debugging:

```bash
npx playwright test --trace on
```

## Test Reports

After test execution, you can view detailed reports:

1. **HTML Report**:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

This opens an interactive HTML report showing test results, timelines, and screenshots.

2. **CI Report**:

The GitHub Actions workflow includes a formatted test report in the workflow summary.

## Linting and Formatting

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality:

1. **Run linter**:

```bash
npm run lint
```

2. **Format code**:

Code is automatically formatted after save

## Git Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically:

- Format code with Prettier
- Prevent commits with linting errors

## Best Practices

This project follows these quality engineering best practices:

- Page Object Model for maintainable selectors

- Environment variables for sensitive data

- Cross-browser testing coverage

- Automated code quality checks

- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

- Containerized testing with Docker

## Contributing

1. Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass (npm run test-all)
4. Run linter (npm run lint)
5. Commit using conventional commit messages
6. Open a pull request
